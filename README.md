# Multimorbidity Risk Network
### This repository stores the paper- *What can we learn from multimorbidity? A deep dive from its risk patterns to the corresponding patient profiles* related code and demo data. Anyone using this code for academic research please cite it. Thanks!
### The code continues to be updated.
